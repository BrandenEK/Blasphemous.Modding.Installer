### Manual installation
1. Install or update the modding tools
   - Click the link to download the tools for your operating system
      - Blasphemous 1 ([Windows](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous.ModdingTools/raw/main/modding-tools-windows.zip)/[Linux](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous.ModdingTools/raw/main/modding-tools-linux.zip)/[Mac](https://github.com/BrandenEK/Blasphemous.ModdingTools/raw/main/modding-tools-mac.zip))
      - Blasphemous 2 ([Windows](https://github.com/BrandenEK/BlasII.ModdingTools/raw/main/modding-tools-windows.zip)/Linux/Mac)
   - Extract the contents of the zip file into the game's root directory
   - You should now have a folder called "Modding" in the same folder as "Blasphemous.exe" or "Blasphemous 2.exe"
   - If using Steam on unix, follow the [BepInEx docs](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/steam_interop.html) to configure it properly
   - For Blasphemous 2 on Linux:
      - Download the [MelonLoader installer](https://melonloader.co/download) (for Linux).
      - Run the installer, select Blasphemous 2, select the latest version (`0.7.1`).
      - Paste `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="version=n,b" %command%` in the launch options of the game on Steam (see Library > Blasphemous 2 > Properties > General).
      - Start a first time the game to download and install the dependencies for MelonLoader (this is automatic, but be patient).
      - Close the game, unzip the [Windows modding tools](https://github.com/BrandenEK/BlasII.ModdingTools/raw/main/modding-tools-windows.zip) inside the game's directory.
      - Install your mods inside the `Modding` directory.
      - Start the game.
2. Install or update the mod
   - On the mod's github page, navigate to the latest release
   - Download the file called "ModName.zip" and extract the contents of the zip file into the "Modding" folder
   - You should now have a file called "ModName.dll" in the "Modding/plugins" folder
   - Repeat this step for all of the mod's dependencies
